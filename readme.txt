== Description ==

Configure settings for all external links on your site.

= Features =

= Easy to use =

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I want internal links to be treated as external links. How? =

You could add `rel="external"` to those internal links that should be treated as external. The plugin settings will also be applied to those links.

= Links to my own domain are treated as external links. Why? =

Links pointing to your WordPress site (`wp_url`) are internal links. All other links will be treated as external links.

= All links to my subdomains should be treated internal links. How? =

Add your main domain to the option "Ingore links (URL) containing..." and they will not be treated as external.

After activating the plugin all options are already set to make your external links SEO friendly. Optionally you can also set the target for opening in a new window or tab or styling options, like adding an icon.

= Action hook: wpel_ready =
The plugin also has a hook when ready, f.e. to add extra filters:
`function extra_filters($filter_callback, $object) {
	add_filter('some_filter', $filter_callback);
}
add_action('wpel_ready', 'extra_filters');`

= Filter hook 1: wpel_external_link =
The wpel_external_link filter gives you the possibility to manipulate output of the mailto created by the plugin, like:
`function special_external_link($created_link, $original_link, $label, $attrs, $is_ignored_link) {
	// skip links that contain the class "not-external"
	if (isset($attrs['class']) && strpos($attrs['class'], 'not-external') !== false) {
		return $original_link;
	}

	return '<b>'. $created_link .'</b>';
}

add_filter('wpel_external_link', 'special_external_link', 10, 5);`

Now all external links will be processed and wrapped around a `<b>`-tag. And links containing the class "not-external" will not be processed by the plugin at all (and stay the way they are).


= Filter hook 2: wpel_internal_link =
With the internal filter you can manipulate the output of the internal links on your site. F.e.:
`
function special_internal_link($link, $label, $attrs) {
    return '<b>'. $link  .'</b>';
}

add_filter('wpel_internal_link', 'special_internal_link', 10, 3);`

In this case all internal links will be made bold.
